# StyleVision: Deep Learning for Trouser Fit Classification

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for the "Extracting Attributes from Fashion Images 2" competition hosted on Kaggle. The goal of the competition is to accurately identify and extract the trouser fit type from fashion apparel trousers images.

### Competition Details

- **Competition URL:** [Extracting Attributes from Fashion Images 2](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/extracting-attributes-from-fashion-images-2)
- **Description:** The competition involves accurately identifying trouser fit types from a diverse set of fashion images. The dataset is internally tagged with class imbalances, and the challenge is to overcome noise and errors in the tags to achieve high categorization accuracy.
- **Challenges:**
  - Data is internally tagged with class imbalance.
  - Accuracy of tags has some errors (noise).
  - Participants need to devise efficient training strategies to address these challenges.

## Dataset

- **Dataset URL:** [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/extracting-attributes-from-fashion-images-2)
- **Instructions:** Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle competition URL and organize it in the project directory.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated based on Categorization Accuracy between the predicted class and the tagged target. The accuracy is calculated on the predicted class. The submission file should follow a specific format, including the file name and the predicted class by the model for each respective image.

### Submission Format

For each submission, the submission file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
file_name,predicted_class
image1.jpg,class1
image2.jpg,class2
...
```
